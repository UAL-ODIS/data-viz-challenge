# Call for proposals

## Summary
This fellowship program is designed to address three known challenges in contemporary higher education:

+ Insufficient technical training for digital or data-intensive research within subject disciplines;
+ Uneven attention to digital pedagogy and strategies for teaching technical concepts within graduate training programs; and
+ A need for ongoing development of modular curricula for emerging technology that can be integrated into the classroom and extracurricular workshops, or used independently by scholars and researchers at the point of need.

## Eligibility
Graduate students enrolled full time in both Spring 2020 and Fall 2020 in any college or discipline.

## What you get
Support for building technical skills related to your research and opportunities to apply instructional design and digital pedagogy by creating and delivering new workshop content.

## What we get
An opportunity to activate a multidisciplinary network of graduate students engaged in digital scholarship or data science, and a suite of instructional materials that can be reused and integrated into future instruction and training.

## Time commitment
The program runs January 2020-December 2020 and includes weekly meetings on Friday afternoons while classes are in session as well as self-directed learning time, with an estimated commitment of approximately 4 hours per week.

## Stipend
$1,500 total, disbursed in two installments.

## Deliverables
A public workshop in Fall 2020 and accompanying curricular materials that are made openly available online. Fellows can choose from the following Creative Commons licenses/marks so that their curricular materials can be reused and adapted by others: [CC BY](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/), [CC BY-SA](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/), [CC BY-NC](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/), [CC BY-NC-SA](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/), or [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/public-domain/cc0).

## How to apply
Applications are due **October 15, 2019** (by 11:59 pm local Arizona time).

Please submit the following materials to [https://forms.gle/DU8FWuL3txTBmNeaA](https://forms.gle/DU8FWuL3txTBmNeaA):

+ A statement of intent, in 2 pages or less, that addresses
    1. the technical skill that you would like to pursue through self-directed learning as a member of the cohort,
    2. how this skill applies to your research trajectory,
    3. your interest and willingness to design and deliver public workshops that are open to the UA community, and
    4. what diverse perspectives or representation you would contribute to the cohort.
+ A current C.V.
+ Contact information for two references, at least one in your academic program

## Application evaluation
All applicants will be notified by November 30. Selected applicants may be contacted for 20-minute Zoom interviews during the review period. Applicants will be selected based on the strength of their individual statements with preference given to enhancing the overall diversity of the cohort and interest in fellowship projects whose outcomes will serve the needs of the broader UA community.

## Sample projects
We welcome applications that address any aspect of digital scholarship or data science, including projects focused on tools, methods, or techniques. Some potential areas for exploration could include:

+ Web scraping, text data mining, natural language processing
+ Digital publishing platforms, electronic notebooks, digital project management
+ Data visualization, 3-D modeling
+ Data cleaning, data analysis
+ Network analysis, neural networks, machine learning
