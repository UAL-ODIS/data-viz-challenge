This is the code repository for the University of Arizona Digital Scholarship & Data Science Fellowship program web page.

Local set up via [https://help.github.com/en/articles/setting-up-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll](https://help.github.com/en/articles/setting-up-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll)

Ended up removing lots of unused Ruby dependencies, updating (installing) ruby, then running `bundle update listen` in terminal (within the root directory of the repository, arizona). Site then served with `bundle exec jekyll serve`.
